My name is Serge (pronounced /sɛrdʒ/), I am a full-stack engineer enthusiastic about open-source, blockchains and crypto infrastructure

Most of my experience is building apps with React and Node.js, but currently I am focused heavily on 🦀 Rust development. 
I enjoy working on dev tooling, CLIs, monitors, event processors, and other backend services for blockchain systems.
