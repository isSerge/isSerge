My name is Serge (pronounced /sɛrdʒ/), I am a full-stack engineer enthusiastic about open-source, blockchains and crypto infrastructure (despite all the grift in space 🥲)

Most of my experience is building apps with React and Node.js, but in recent years, I’ve focused heavily on 🦀 Rust development. 
I enjoy working on dev tooling, CLIs, monitors, event processors, and other backend services for blockchain systems.

Feel free to reach out if you are open to collaborating: 📧 github.refurnish231@passinbox.com (yes, it looks shady, but it’s just an alias!)

I might contribute pro bono if: 
1. it's using Rust
2. it's open-source
3. I like the idea
4. the vibes are good
