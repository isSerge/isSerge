My name is Serge (pronounced /sɛrdʒ/), I am a full-stack engineer enthusiastic about open-source, blockchains and crypto infrastructure

Currently focused on 🦀 Rust development. I enjoy working on dev tooling, CLIs, monitors, event processors, and other backend services for blockchain systems.

Feel free to reach out for collaboration: 📧 github.refurnish231@passinbox.com (yes, it looks shady, but it’s just an alias!)

Originally from 🇺🇦 currently based in 🇹🇭
